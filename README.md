Hi! In my life I passed some problems in TI career.

I've decided to join my scripts into a single repository. I could check any of them when needed and share files with those who are interested.

You're free to fork or make PR with new script. This repo it's not only mine. You're free, also, to copy and of these scripts to use on your job. Distribute them. Just keep the copyright, add your own and let's share our wonderful job across the planet.
