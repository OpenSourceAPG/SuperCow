# SuperCow

Hi! In my life I passed some problems in TI career. 

I've decided to join my scripts into a single repository. I could check any of them when needed and share files with those who are interested. 

You're free to fork or make PR with new script. This repo it's not only mine. You're free, also, to copy and of these scripts to use on your job. Distribute them. Just keep the copyright, add your own and let's share our wonderful job across the planet. 

## The repo

I can explain some of files here, to give a upper vision of the work.

* [delete_files_by_extension.bat](https://github.com/andrepg/SuperCow/blob/master/delete_files_by_extension.bat) search for files with specific extension in a path and all of their subfolders. Once a file it's found, the script will delete it. It's based on Batch Script and it's capable of textual output to user (allowing intercept to a file, also).
  > Tested on Windows 7, 10 and Server 2003 - based on nature of script, should work on any Windows above NT

* [delete_old_files_with_powershell.ps1](https://github.com/andrepg/SuperCow/blob/master/delete_old_files_with_powershell.ps1) it's a simple snippet to delete files older than a given number of days. Can be configured to run autonomous based on PowerShell and Scheduled Tasks
  > Tested on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012 - *could be possible* to run on machines with Windows 7 and **PowerShell v1**, at least

* THERE MORE COMING ...
