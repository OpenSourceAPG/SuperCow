#   Hi! I'm Andre Paul. Born in Brazil, developer of original version of this tool.
# 
# My problem was getting a list of changed files between my last build in Jenkins 
# and the latest commit in a certain branch. The files are copied to a certain folder
# to use CI/CD and upload to FTP server. 
# 
# Our first application that use this script relies on a private repository and inside a folder
# called 'application'. So, there well be some references to this path, and you can fork and remove it.
#
# This is an OpenSource code, in first time. You can copy, change, use it and distribute as you want. 
# But you can be a gentleman keeping copyright or making a mention to the SuperCow repository 
# hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/andrepg/SuperCow)
# 
# 
# Get filename without application/ preffix
# echo ${file#"application/"}
